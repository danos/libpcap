Description: Development library and header files for libpcap 0.8
 Headers, static libraries, and documentation for the libpcap library.
 .
 libpcap (Packet CAPture) provides a portable framework for low-level
 network monitoring.  Applications include network statistics
 collection, security monitoring, network debugging, etc.
 .
 Since almost every system vendor provides a different interface for 
 packet capture, and since there are several tools that require this 
 functionality, we've created this system-independent API to ease in 
 porting and to alleviate the need for several system-dependent packet 
 capture modules in each application.
